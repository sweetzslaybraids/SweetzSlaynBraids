          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Welcome to the world of Mz Sweetz's hair braiding & natural haircare
            zone I was born and raised In Chicago's westSide where I found the
            inspiration & passion in braiding as a young girl watching celebrity
            stylists on television excel in their craft. . I then decided to
            teach myself how to braid and study natural haircare of all cultural
            hair textures by watching & studying online videos, taking specific
            online braiding classes as well and drawing clientele at discount
            prices to have personal contact experiences to perfect my craft. As
            an adult, I have become a supreme multicultural braider and natural
            haircare stylist now serving over 300 clients from the East Coast to
            the West Coast where I enjoy meeting new people and networking with
            other fellow stylists to learn more to exceed in my craft and
            expertise. I'm always eager to learn more and keep up with all the
            new trends and methods currently. I am just a city girl with a bonus
            personality that matches my passion as a braider. I take all
            concerns from my clients as if it was my crown which my clients
            appreciate the most about me. I enjoy making hair grow as well as
            passing on good information and recommendations to clients to
            maintain their haircare in between services in my chair. It gives a
            sense of knowledge to each individual who personally knows where we
            started from the beginning and tends to give more self-motivation to
            want to take care of their crown more in-depth. I also enjoy
            creating hair growth oils that are for all hair including alopecia
            clients. I overall enjoy the end of every individual visit to see
            their response to their new look and feel their experience with
            sweetzslaynbraids
